# KRSan (KRS Planner)

KRSan is a professional course schedule optimization platform designed for Indonesian university students. Built with a focus on simplicity and efficiency, it leverages AI to transform the complex process of semester planning into a seamless, automated experience.

## Core Philosophy

**"Simplicity in Complexity"**  
KRSan acts as a manifestation of empathy towards the administrative struggles of students. By automating the "optimizer" role that students usually perform manually, it allows them to focus more on actual academic achievement.

## Key Features

### 1. Architect Engine

A structured, 3-stage workflow to design the perfect semester:

- **Configure:** Establish academic parameters (University, Study Program, Semester, Max SKS).
- **Select:** Browse and add courses from the catalog or master data repository.
- **View:** Visualize conflict-free schedule combinations generated by the system.

### 2. Smart Generate (AI Optimization)

Leverages Gemini AI to design the best schedule based on specific preferences, such as:

- Avoiding morning classes.
- Grouping classes on specific days.
- Prioritizing specific lecturers.

### 3. Intelligence Scraper

An advanced administrative tool that uses AI to extract structured course data from unstructured text or raw portal copies. This ensures the Master Data Repository remains up-to-date with minimal manual entry.

### 4. Master Data Repository

A centralized database supporting multiple study programs (Informatika, SI, Teknik Industri, Teknik Kimia, etc.) with real-time search and prodi-based filtering.

### 5. Multi-language Support

Full internationalization (Indonesian and English) to ensure accessibility for a wider student demographic.

### 6. Service Token System

A daily-reset token system to manage access to premium AI features, ensuring sustainable resource usage.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** React 19, Vite, TypeScript
